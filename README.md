# media_to_webm
Creates .webm files to upload on /gif/ or /wsg/

To use, just run the script with files as arguments. On Windows this can be done easily by creating a .bat file containing
```
cls
python "C:\Path\to\media_to_webm.py" %*
```
and adding that to the Send To context menu. Then just select what files you want, right-click, `Send to > Media To Webm`
